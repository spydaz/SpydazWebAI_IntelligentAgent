**THE AGENT MODEL**

Multiple agent architectures created to for fill specific purposes can be created to work as individual entities or symbiotically.

**“An agent is deemed to be an agent when it can perceive its environment (environmentally aware) via sensors and interacts with its environment via actuators.” **
**(Norvig, 1995)**


Agent models are used to solve individual tasks within the AI framework. A system can be said to be a collection of agents working on individual goals of the overall system. Language processing being a single agent, information storage and retrieval being another. This is akin to the human mindset with various agents in the body and mind to serve or daily needs, which could be walking talking or thinking. Often decisions are based on a combination of results from these agents and task which may also need to be performed also need agents to interact and communicate. Forming a network of agents and exchange of information. All information evaluated form the basis of an action or result being produced. 
There are various types of agents suggested by Peter Norvig and Stewart Russell. (Norvig, 1995)
